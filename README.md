# rmrk-emote-script

If you are looking for a script to create multiple addresses and emote specific emotes, then I would like to refer to the [kanaria-hatchery](https://github.com/kianenigma/kanaria-hatchery) script by [kianenigma](https://github.com/kianenigma).

This script is heavily inspired by the above mentioned script, so please have a look a that script as well and give it a :star:.

The way this script differs is that it sends 1700+ emojis in **one batch call** to be executed on the node.

‚ö†Ô∏è **_PLEASE BE AWARE THAT RUNNING THE SCRIPT WITH ALL 1700+ EMOTES WILL BE ROUGHLY ~0.05 KSM_**

‚ö†Ô∏è **_PLEASE DON'T RUN THIS ON A HATCHING EGG_**

An example of the [extrinsic after running the script will look like this](https://kusama.subscan.io/extrinsic/0x77e1baf6e368644c60b6b3ffade989ff4298b76259e8e8a2edd29e6c7bed914f)  

üå± Please support me if you'd like üòä

## Getting started

First have [polkadot js api installed](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/start/install).

Clone repo and install npm packages.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/martinloesethjensen/rmrk-emote-batch
cd rmrk-emote-batch
npm install
```

## How to run

Specify rpc endpoint, egg id and seed phrase in the command.

I would first test on Westend before trying it out on kusama. But try in small batches of emotes as you might not have enough westies.   

[Westend faucet info here.](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/maintain-networks#westend-faucet)

```sh
# Sending all emotes (roughly ~0.05 KSM)
node index.js --id <RMRK_ID> -e wss://kusama-rpc.polkadot.io -s "<SEED_PHRASE>"

# Sending specific emotee
# Specified emotes need to be space separated.
node index.js --id <RMRK_ID> -e wss://kusama-rpc.polkadot.io -s "<SEED_PHRASE>" --emotes üöÄ üéâ

# Removing specific emotes from complete list of emotes
# Specified emotes need to be space separated.
node index.js --id <RMRK_ID> -e wss://kusama-rpc.polkadot.io -s "<SEED_PHRASE>" -r ü§© ü•≥
```

‚ÑπÔ∏è Please note that the [`emojis` list in index.js](index.js) contains many emoji unicodes. So if you want to emote with less emojis then just remove some from the list before running it. It is also possible to specify a specific list of emojis by using the command: `--emotes` and providing a space sperated list of emotjis.

You can find [emoji unicodes here](https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html) and [here](./emoji-unicodes.txt).

### Funding Accounts Example

```sh
node index.js -e wss://kusama-rpc.polkadot.io --receiving-addresses <FILE_WITH_ADDRESSES> --funding-account <FILE_WITH_SEED> --amount <AMOUNT>
```
